# Pebble - Timer

## Todos

- find error with card
  - app will crash when card with body-text is shown (only on pebble, not on emulator)
  - if body is set after card is shown, app will crash only sometimes but not reliable
  - timeout of 500ms before body is set seems to work most of the time, less timeout decreases reliability
- add background functionality
